## Parking Lot Management System
## Overview
The Parking Lot Management System is a simple C-based program designed to manage the operations of a parking lot. It allows users to add vehicle details, remove vehicles, calculate parking charges, and display all currently parked vehicles. The program demonstrates the use of fundamental C programming concepts such as arrays, structures, file handling, and menu-driven programming.

--Features
## Add Vehicle:

Enter details such as vehicle plate number, owner name, and hours parked.
Ensures the parking lot capacity is not exceeded.
Remove Vehicle:

## Remove a vehicle using its plate number.
Calculates and displays the parking fee based on the number of hours parked.
## Display All Vehicles:

Lists all vehicles currently in the parking lot with their details (plate number, owner name, and hours parked).
## Capacity Management:
Ensures the parking lot does not exceed its maximum capacity.
## Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Compiler: GCC or any compatible C compiler

## Concepts Demonstrated
